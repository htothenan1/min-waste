## What am I?

Waste-Not.

## What is my goal?

Empower users to live a minimum-waste life. My hope is to provide an easy-to-use tool to track the current contents of a user's kitchen. Simply knowing what food you have in your kitchen has shown to reduce an individual's food waste significantly. Additioanally, we will develop features that teach the user about the minimum-waste lifestyle, and how to apply it.

## What's so bad about food waste?

40 percent of food in the US goes uneaten! At the same time, 1 in 8 Americans don't have enough food to eat. Isn't that absurd? That uneaten food also takes up 20 percent of all landfills, and ends up being a terrible producer of greenhouse gas. Additionally, the resources that are spent to produce and deliver uneaten food to consumers are immense.

The only way this problem goes away is if we can collectively improve our behavior.
